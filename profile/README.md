Hey! With [Octomind end-to-end tests](https://www.octomind.dev/) your can create (AI auto-generate, record, import via [Octomind MCP](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/octomind-mcp)), run and maintain end-to-end tests in standard Playwright code in the cloud. We work on staging and production, on public apps and on [private ones](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/private-location-worker). 

Whether you want to make sure you didn't break a new build or use the e2e test for synthetic monitoring, you test suite will scale automatically, no devops required. 

## Generate tests the way you prefer
https://www.octomind.dev/product/generate-tests

- with your AI client connected via MCP
- import from test management tools
- record a specific test case with our recorder
- prompt out AI agent with natural language

Octomind supports complex test setup - unlimited environments, CI/CD integratetion, custom variables, test sharding, automated validation, email flow testing, 2FA logins, data isolation, shared auth state, and [more]([octomind](https://octomind.dev/docs).

## Execute tests at scale - fully managed and deterministic 
https://www.octomind.dev/product/run-e2e-tests

- Free hosting
- Tests run in parallel to run a test suite of any size fast
- You can plug us into your [CI/CD](http://localhost:3000/integrations/integrations-overview), schedule test runs in our app, via curl or locally
- [Octomind‚Äôs APIs](https://octomind.dev/docs/api-reference/test-targets/retrieve-all-test-targets) fit into your existing setup
- Your code is visible at all times and you can download the vanilla Playwright code to run your tests locally
- SOC2 and GDPR compliant, secure testing of private apps via [private location worker](https://octomind.dev/docs/proxy/private-location)
- [We don't use AI in runtime](https://www.octomind.dev/blog/ai-doesnt-belong-in-test-runtime)

## Octomind tests are easy to maintain
https://www.octomind.dev/product/debug-tests 

- we pre-classify test failure root cause automatically and cluster them
- you can compare previous successful test runs side by side to investigate the context
- we'll give you an annotated timelime to swipe through what happened in the run at any given point
- you can use advanced debugging by inspecting Playwright traces of download the open source [Debugtopus](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/debugtopus) to debug locally
- our AI agent will suggest you an auto-fix of the broken test steps
