# Auto-generated, hosted Playwright end-to-end tests for web developers 🐙

Hey! We host and run [AI-generated end-to-end tests](https://www.octomind.dev/) in standard Playwright code in the cloud. You'll just give us a URL and we will auto-generate, host and run your end-to-end test suite. We work on both staging and production, as long as we can access the website.  

Whether you want to make sure you didn't break a new build or use the e2e test for synthetic monitoring, we offer a fast and easy way to QA your web app. 

If a test goes red, we alert you and pinpoint the bug in screenshots. You can go to [Playwright Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) for more details and use our open source [Debugtopus](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev) for local debugging.     

## Octomind test hosting and running
- Free hosting, unlimited test runs
- Unlimited projects/ URLs
- Tests are run in parallel, so your test suite will complete in 20 minutes or less, regardless of size
- You can plug us it into your CI/CD or schedule test runs in our app
- Octomind can run next to your existing test suite, no need swap any existing tech stack
- You can download the vanilla Playwright code to run your tests locally

## AI agent will save you time spent on 

1. **thinking about what tests you need to write** >>> It goes through your app, checks what tests would make sense and auto-generates them. If it sees cookie or required login test, it autogenerates them and populates them as dependency for other tests.

2. **writing tests** >>> Beyond fully auto-generated test created by the "AI discovery" ru, the AI agent generates test steps automatically based on a prompt when adding a new test. In case you prefer a non-AI routine, we have a test recorder as an option for adding new tests. 

3. **figuring out what is broken** >>> We'll show you what test step is not working. In test results we'll pinpoint the bug.  

4. **WIP: auto-maintenance and flakiness resistnace** >>> We are looking into how we can use our AI agent to auto-fix broken tests and fortify them against flakiness.
