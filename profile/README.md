# Automated Playwright UI tests for web developers üêô 

Hey! We're automating end-to-end tests using Playwright test code. You'll just give us a URL and with the help of AI we will discover, execute and maintain your end-to-end tests in Playwright. You can use our app or plug it into your CI/CD. To review the results we've built in the [Playwright Test Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) and open sourced [Debugtopus](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev) for local debugging.     

* This is where you **[set-up your first UI test](https://app.octomind.dev/setup/url?utm_source=github&utm_medium=txt-lnk)** 
* These are our [docs](https://docs.octomind.dev/)
* You can find more info on [octomind.dev](https://www.octomind.dev/)

Octomind can be triggered from your CI, these are the integrations:  
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-action-execute)
* [Azure DevOps](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/automagically-azure-devops-task-execute)
* [Vercel](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/vercel-actions-example)
* [Jenkins](https://github.com/OctoMind-dev/jenkins-integration)  

Octomind integrations are all open source. We‚Äôd encourage you to contribute to the existing or compose new integrations for other CI/CD providers. We‚Äôll happily take over and maintain them further.
