## Autonomous browser tests for web apps

We felt the frustration of inefficient work and suffered in the aftermath of broken releases. TDD is our jam, but writing, running and maintaining end-to-end tests is a back-breaking exercise. We’re creating a testing tool we wish we always had.  

We're still in stealth, so this is as much as we can share. We'll be adding more information as our Octo grows into a real cephalopod.
